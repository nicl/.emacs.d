Custom emacs setup
==================

This is my custom emacs setup. I rely on the [emacs starter kit](https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit) for my defaults.

The rest is mainly to ensure some useful packages are installed.

I mostly use Emacs for writing Clojure code at the moment. For PHP and JS I tend to default to Sublime Text 2.
