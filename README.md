Custom emacs setup
==================

This is my custom emacs setup. I rely on the [emacs starter
kit](https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit) for my
defaults.

The rest is mainly to ensure some useful packages are installed.

I mostly use Emacs for writing Clojure code at the moment. For PHP and
JS I tend to default to Sublime Text 2.

UPDATE (March 2013): now that I am mostly writing Scala with work
Emacs has become more of a general text editor. I also use Org mode
for TODOs :).
